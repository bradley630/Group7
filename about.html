                <p> Season 6 marks another set of changes for players to utilize in-game, but one weapon that hasn't budged in COD Mobile is the DL Q33 sniper rifle.
                     To this day, it remains one of the top-tier weapons in the game, especially for players that prioritize snipers. 
                     At this point in the life cycle of COD Mobile, there are a ton of weapon choices for players to use.
                      It can be hard to tell which sniper rifles, in particular, are the best to choose from. 
                      Considering some excel at separate areas such as pure damage or rate of fire, it can be hard to label one sniper as the absolute best. But the DL Q33 comes close to that title.
                       It's perhaps the most well-rounded sniper rifle in COD Mobile, and it has been in the hands of players well before Season 6. 
                       It offers up some fantastic accuracy, consistent damage that is sure to take players out, and it has a decent fire rate for a bolt action rifle. There isn't much that the DL Q33 can't pull off.
                        And with the right attachments in a loadout, players in COD Mobile can hit some amazing snipes.
